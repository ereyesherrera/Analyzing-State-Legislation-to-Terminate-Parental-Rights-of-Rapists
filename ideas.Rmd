This is the College Scorecard Data Set. It has information on higher education institutions in the US, including: information about the institution, academics, admissions, costs, student body, financial aid, and completion. It also has data on earnings post-graduation. This is only the most recent data available (I belive it is 2017). There is another file that has a glossary for all of the terms, since they are abbreviated in this data set. I will work on uploading it. -Max
