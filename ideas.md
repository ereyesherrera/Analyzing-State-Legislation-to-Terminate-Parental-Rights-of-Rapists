This is the College Scorecard Data Set. It has information on higher education institutions in the US, including: information about the institution, academics, admissions, costs, student body, financial aid, and completion. It also has data on earnings post-graduation. This is only the most recent data available (I belive it is 2017). There is another file that has a glossary for all of the terms, since they are abbreviated in this data set. I will work on uploading it. -Max

Most_Recent_Cohorts_Scorecard_Elements <-

With the recent CA wildfires going on, I was interested in analyzing the history of wildfires in California. I found [this Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/california-wildfires-people-climate) that did some analysis, but I think we would be able to expand it a bit more.

Buzzfeed provided the code to clean up and visualize the data the way they did [at this page](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2018-07-wildfire-trends/) and they also provided their Github repo with their data [here](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-07-wildfire-trends).

They retrieved their information from the [California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Fire Perimeters Geodatabase](https://frap.fire.ca.gov/frap-projects/fire-perimeters/) and this will be a good resource since it explains all the variable names.


```r
ca_fires <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-07-wildfire-trends/master/data/calfire_frap.csv")
ca_damage <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-07-wildfire-trends/master/data/calfire_damage.csv")
```

Number of days each fire burned

```r
ca_fires %>% 
  mutate(total_days = cont_date - alarm_date) %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(x = total_days)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(0, 180) +
  ylim(0, 1000) 
```

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

```
## Warning: Removed 7527 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_bar).
```

Causes of CA Fires - come back and put in the name for each number (see below - Edwin)


```r

  cause_name = c("Lightning", "Equipment Use", "Smoking", "Campfire", "Debris", "Railroad", "Arson", "Playing with Fire", "Miscellaneous", "Vehicle", "Power Line", "Firefighter Training", "Non-Firefighter Training", "Unknown/Unidentified", "Structure", "Aircraft", "Volcanic", "Escaped Prescribed Burn", "Illegal Alien Campfire")
